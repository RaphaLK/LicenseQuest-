### Inspiration

Every year, millions of hopeful drivers feel the pressure of preparing for their driving test. The stakes are high and the road to success can be riddled with obstacles—from mastering complex traffic laws to finding the perfect low-traffic street for practice. Our platform addresses these pain points head-on. We provide aspiring drivers with real-time data to locate quiet streets, detailed maps for finding ideal parking spots to hone their skills, and engaging tools to deepen their knowledge of traffic regulations. This isn't just a study aid; it's a comprehensive driving test preparation assistant that ensures when test day comes, our users are not just ready—they're confident. With our platform, passing the driving test becomes a journey well navigated. Not only do our users feel more confident, it also helps to make the roads safer. Since young drivers are more likely to get into car accidents, our app helps teach and guide young drivers to travel safely.

### What it does

LicenseQuest will fully prepare users for both the Permit Test and the Behind-the-Wheel Drive Test. Using flashcards created from real test questions, users will learn all of the concepts, rules, and signs necessary to ace the Permit Test. LicenseQuest can also map users to actual test routes used by the local DMVs and give directions on how to complete the route. Prior to taking the practice test, beginner users can find safe, low-traffic areas to practice driving in a controlled environment. They can find parallel parking spots and empty parking lots to practice parking in stalls.
How we built it

We utilized Figma and React Native for the front end of our web app to develop the UI. In addition, we used for JavaScript our backend and made API calls to Google Maps and Inrix's routing, offstreet, on-street, and segment speed. For testing purposes, we tested the APIs through Postman.

### Challenges we ran into

We ran into challenges transitioning our frontend design on Figma to react-native code published on the AWS Cloud. In addition, configuring the most optimal algorithm for routes and heatmaps was difficult to implement at first.
Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of our communication and teamwork. Many concepts and languages were new to some team members, but we were able to successfully learn quickly and contribute to the team. We are very proud of the User Interface on our app because we find it visually pleasing and fully functional.

### What we learned

Collaborating on this project taught us the importance of effective communication and problem-solving. Overcoming front and back-end challenges required a collective effort, and the experience strengthened our team's collaboration skills. We also gained valuable experience using INRIX APIs which gave us deep insights into best practices for integration and testing. This knowledge will be beneficial in future projects in school and industry.
What's next for LicenseQuest

In future iterations of LicenseQuest, we hope to add a leaderboard, badge certifications for users, and accurate route prediction algorithms outside of San Francisco. In addition, we would like to improve the overall experience by adding new features. For example, having a practice quiz for the permit test, being able to shuffle the flashcards, and being able to star the flash cards.
